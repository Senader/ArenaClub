First 2d game using Epitech's minilibx

Why creating a game ?
In order to practice the C language and have some fun.

What is it really ? What type of game and so ?
It's for now a 2d turn based combat game. It's pretty similar to pokemons combats.
We'll improve the game to make more characters playable, more enemies, items...

Feel free to suggest any improvement to the game !
